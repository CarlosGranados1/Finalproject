Another thing you can do to keep your self ocupied during the holiday is just watch a bunch of horror movies. You can also make your pet wear a costume. It'll be really funny. If you don't want to go trick-or-treating just go to a random candy store and buy some candy for your self. Then probably eat ice cream if you're sad.</p>
